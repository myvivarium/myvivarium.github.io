Your lab or vivarium can launch its own MyVivarium Web App using a cloud-hosting provider of your choice. On our Github repo, we provide you an option to free-trial a cloud-hosting solution to launch your MyVivarium App. Alternatively, you can also choose to host it locally rather than in the cloud.

Detailed instructions on web component installation can be found in our GitHub Repo: [Link](https://github.com/myvivarium/MyVivarium?tab=readme-ov-file#myvivarium)

The RPi-IoT component installation can be performed by following this detailed wiki in a separate but linked repo: [Link](https://github.com/myvivarium/RPi-IoT/wiki)
